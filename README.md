# DFN-Hawkes
The repository implements three inference methods (Gibbs sampler, EM algorithm and mean-field approximation) for the sigmoid nonlinear multivariate Hawkes processes (SNMHP) and its dynamic version (dynamic-SNMHP) in the paper "Efficient Inference for Dynamic Flexible Interactions of Neural Populations". 

We recommend to read the tutorial of both models to get familiar with this module. It introduces the key points in the model and illustrates how to perfrom simulation and inference.

For any further details, please refer to the paper. 

# Update
The implementation of Pólya-Gamma sampling depends on the package `PyPólyaGamma` which is available at https://github.com/slinderman/pypolyagamma.
